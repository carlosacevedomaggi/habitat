# Subtask 1.3 Findings: Environment, Permissions, and API Response Analysis

**Orchestrator Note:** This file was created because `DATA_LIFECYCLE_ANALYSIS.MD` was consistently unreadable by the `read_file` tool, despite `list_files` confirming its presence in the workspace. Please consolidate these findings into the main `DATA_LIFECYCLE_ANALYSIS.MD` document if possible, or advise on how to resolve the read issue for the original file.

## 1. Environment Configuration

*   **Backend Configuration ([`backend/core/config.py`](backend/core/config.py:1), [`.env.example`](.env.example:1)):**
    *   Settings are loaded from environment variables with defaults. Key variables include `DATABASE_URL`, `SECRET_KEY`, `API_BASE_URL`, and `BACKEND_CORS_ORIGINS`.
    *   The [`.env.example`](.env.example:1) file shows `NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL` for frontend API communication and `NON_ADMIN_CAN_VIEW_ALL_CONTACTS=true`, which is significant for controlling data visibility within the admin panel for non-admin roles.
    *   No direct environment-level switching of configurations (e.g., different databases for admin vs. public contexts) was found that would explain the public data visibility issues. Differences arise from how these configurations are used (e.g., admin panel using authentication tokens).

*   **Frontend Configuration ([`frontend/next.config.js`](frontend/next.config.js:1)):**
    *   Includes `rewrites` to proxy `/api/:path*` requests to `http://backend:8000/api/:path*`, standard for Dockerized Next.js setups.
    *   Image optimization patterns are defined but are unlikely related to data visibility.
    *   No specific configurations were found that would inherently cause different data fetching or rendering for public vs. admin routes beyond the use of environment variables like `NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL`.

## 2. Data Access Controls & Logic

*   **Backend ([`backend/main.py`](backend/main.py:1)):**
    *   `CORSMiddleware` is configured permissively (`allow_origins=["*"]`), unlikely to cause role-based discrepancies.
    *   No top-level custom middleware was identified that filters data differently for public vs. admin requests on the *same* endpoint. Access control is generally handled within specific routers or their dependencies.

*   **Backend Property Routes ([`backend/routers/properties.py`](backend/routers/properties.py:1), [`backend/crud/properties.py`](backend/crud/properties.py:1)):**
    *   The `read_properties` list endpoint (`GET /api/properties/`) uses an `get_optional_current_user` dependency.
        *   The `crud_property.get_properties` function filters the list of properties for users with the `staff` role, showing only properties where `assigned_to_id` matches the staff member's ID.
        *   For other authenticated roles (admin, manager) and for unauthenticated (public) users, no such role-based filtering of *which properties are returned* is applied by default beyond standard query parameters.
        *   Crucially, the *fields and structure* of the returned property objects are not altered based on authentication status or role.
    *   The `read_property` single item endpoint (`GET /api/properties/{property_id}/`) does not use authentication and returns the full property data.

*   **Backend Team Routes ([`backend/routers/team.py`](backend/routers/team.py:1), [`backend/crud/team.py`](backend/crud/team.py:1)):**
    *   The `read_team` list endpoint (`GET /api/team/`) and `read_member` single item endpoint (`GET /api/team/{member_id}/`) do not use authentication.
    *   They return full team member data without any field alteration based on user status.

*   **Frontend Application Shell ([`frontend/pages/_app.js`](frontend/pages/_app.js:1), [`frontend/components/Layout.js`](frontend/components/Layout.js:1)):**
    *   These provide general application structure and wrap pages with `SettingsProvider` and `Layout`.
    *   No direct role-based access control logic was found in these top-level components.

*   **Frontend Admin Layout ([`frontend/components/AdminLayout.js`](frontend/components/AdminLayout.js:1)):**
    *   This component is the primary gatekeeper for all `/admin/*` routes.
    *   It enforces authentication by checking a JWT stored in `localStorage`.
    *   It performs role-based authorization, restricting access for users not in `admin`, `manager`, or `staff` roles.
    *   It implements further role-based navigation restrictions (e.g., `manager` or `staff` cannot access `/admin/users`).
    *   It uses `useSettings()` to fetch the `non_admin_can_view_all_contacts` setting, which then controls the visibility of the "Contactos" link in the admin navigation for `manager` and `staff` roles. This clearly differentiates the admin context from the public context.

*   **Frontend Settings Context ([`frontend/context/SettingsContext.js`](frontend/context/SettingsContext.js:1)):**
    *   Loads site-wide settings from the `/api/settings/` backend endpoint.
    *   Provides a `getSetting` function, which `AdminLayout.js` uses to retrieve `non_admin_can_view_all_contacts`.
    *   The context itself doesn't directly alter data visibility based on user status for public pages but provides settings that `AdminLayout.js` uses for authenticated admin users.

## 3. API Response Payload & Header Nuances

*   **Payload Structure:**
    *   Based on the CRUD analysis for properties ([`backend/crud/properties.py`](backend/crud/properties.py:1)) and team members ([`backend/crud/team.py`](backend/crud/team.py:1)), the backend API (for public read endpoints like `GET /api/properties/{id}` or `GET /api/team/`) returns the same *data structure and fields* for a given item, regardless of whether the call is admin-authenticated or public.
    *   The main difference for *lists* of properties is that `staff` users see a filtered list (only their assigned properties). Public users and other authenticated users (admin/manager) receive a list based on general query parameters, not due to role-based omission of fields from the property objects themselves.

*   **Response Headers:**
    *   No evidence was found in the reviewed backend code (e.g., [`backend/main.py`](backend/main.py:1)) to suggest that different caching strategies or security headers (beyond standard CORS handling) are applied to the *same* public API endpoints based on whether an admin authentication token is also present in the request. Standard FastAPI response headers are expected. Differences in headers are more likely between entirely different endpoints (e.g., public vs. admin-only endpoints) rather than conditional changes on the same public endpoint based on an optional token.

## 4. Identified Contributing Factors to Visibility Discrepancy

*   **Admin Panel Differences:**
    *   The primary factor for differentiated experiences within the `/admin/*` section is the logic within [`frontend/components/AdminLayout.js`](frontend/components/AdminLayout.js:1) (authentication, role checks, conditional navigation) and the `non_admin_can_view_all_contacts` setting fetched via [`frontend/context/SettingsContext.js`](frontend/context/SettingsContext.js:1).

*   **Public Visibility Issues (e.g., team members on `about.js`, property status filtering):**
    *   The backend *provides* the necessary data fields (e.g., `status` for properties, all team member details including `is_active` or similar if present in the model, though `is_active` was not explicitly seen for team members in the provided CRUD but would be part of `models.TeamMember` if used).
    *   The root cause of public visibility discrepancies (like team members not showing correctly on [`frontend/pages/about.js`](frontend/pages/about.js:1) or properties not being filtered by `status` on public listing pages) is highly likely to be **frontend logic**:
        *   The frontend is likely not applying the necessary filters (e.g., by `status` for properties) on public pages.
        *   The frontend might be incorrectly rendering, filtering, or fetching team members on the [`frontend/pages/about.js`](frontend/pages/about.js:1).
    *   Environment configurations or backend API payload differences (in terms of field omission for public users) are **not** the primary cause of these specific *public visibility problems*. The backend sends the data; the frontend isn't using it as expected for public display in these instances.
